DATABASE SCHEMA:
Table: ${schema.tableName}
Description: ${schema.description}

Columns:
${columnsDescription}

RULES:
1. Only generate SELECT queries - no INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, DROP, ALTER, CREATE
2. Always use proper date handling with PostgreSQL date functions
3. When filtering by date ranges, use BETWEEN or >= and <= operators
4. For array columns (genre, language, cuisine_type, tags), use UNNEST() to expand them in GROUP BY queries
5. Always handle NULL values appropriately with IS NULL or IS NOT NULL
6. Use ROUND() for numeric aggregations to 2 decimal places
7. Include appropriate ORDER BY clauses for better results
8. Limit results to reasonable amounts (e.g., LIMIT 20 for lists unless specifically asked for more)
9. Use EXTRACT(YEAR FROM date_column::date) for year filtering
10. Use EXTRACT(MONTH FROM date_column::date) for month filtering
11. For "last week", use CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '7 days'
12. For "this month", use EXTRACT(MONTH FROM date_column::date) = EXTRACT(MONTH FROM CURRENT_DATE)
13. When asked about spending or cost, always filter WHERE price/total_price IS NOT NULL
14. The current year is 2026

EXAMPLE QUERIES:
${examplesDescription}

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Return ONLY a JSON object with this exact structure:
{
  "sql": "the SQL query here",
